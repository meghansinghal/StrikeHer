Traditional self-defense training methods are often inaccessible, leaving many women without essential skills to protect themselves.

We aim to 

→ Develop an AI-powered motion tracking system in VR for self-defense training.

→ To provide a sensor-free, interactive experience to improve accessibility and ease of use.

→ Offering real-time feedback and realistic attack simulations to enhance reaction time and technique.

Our solution enables women to train in an immersive AR/VR environment using just a camera. No sensors, no bulky VR headsets. With AI-powered motion tracking, they can practice real-world self-defense techniques anytime, anywhere.

In our AR/VR self-defense training system

→ AI detects body posture and actions in real-time using a webcam or phone camera.

→ Providing instant AI Feedback – "90% correct stance → raise your arm higher!" 
  The system analyzes form and provides real-time corrections using color and number-coded feedback for better posture.

→ Realistic Attack Simulations – Users face AI-generated attackers in multiple scenarios, training their reflexes and enhancing reaction speed for real-world situations.
